I found this weeks homework to be a lot easier.
I started with drafting up the content that i was going to need, then laying it into place..
after that i added all of the tags and the styling that was needed, that seemed to work a lot better.

I struggled a lot with this weeks project. 
I found tables to be terribly confusing and so antiquiated looking.
I really was hoping that I was going to enjoy this section of the class and making the site look better...but everything that i did felt like a struggle.
Atom  for some reason seemed to give me the most headache. It does not autofill any of the tags for me and i end up having to type everything in and hope to god that i didn't miss something. After hours of this struggle, i switched to Brackets and am finding coding to be a lot easier with this.

i fought longer than need be with images...then realized that i needed to ../ enable to have them be seen from the correct file.

not really sure what to write in this...it was all pretty easy to follow
I wrote out my content, then went back and added the correct tags to it
I chose to do my Instructable on baking cookies, mainly because I was craving
cookies and wanted to bake some...two birds one stone!

I did run into issues that Atom crashed on me a lot and wont fill in the tag
options like it was before, making it more difficult to code.
