# My First README.md

**USING BOLD WORDS**

*What I am finding difficult*

-so many pages to look at

-can be incredibly confusing

-so many words and letters with double meanings

-i am getting lost on what video is where and where to put stuff

*What I am finding helpful*

1. All the video walk throughs (thank you)
2. You trying to simplify it on the Moodle site
3. retro aesthetics (always nice to have something pretty)
4. Your quick response time

I find this class to be overwhelming but I am hoping that it just has a hefty learning curve to figure out and to try and wrap my head around... then hopefully everything will fall into place and make more sense. So far just the set up alone is bonkers.


README1 is now done
