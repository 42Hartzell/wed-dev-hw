Because the time of year that it is, I chose to do Dracula  as a book theme site.

I started by finding book cover images that I liked and wanted to use as visuals….so I could base my fonts and colours off of that center images

I will be using  amazon.com for a bio of the author
And probably sticking with amzon or Barnes and Noble for the reviews

I did a wide search for gothic fonts and found a few that are close to the Dracula theme but will also be readable

I then did research and looked at a lot of “dark sites” that are out there to get inspiration and to see what NOT to do. 
I immediately realized the complexity of trying to build a darker themed site…a lot of the come off really cheesy or juts overwhelming and most do not seem like a serious/professional site
