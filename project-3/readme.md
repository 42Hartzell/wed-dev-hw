Because the time of year that it is, I chose to do Dracula  as a book theme site.

I started by finding book cover images that I liked and wanted to use as visualsâ€¦.so I could base my fonts and colours off of that center images

I will be using  http://bramstoker.org/info.html for a bio of the author
and will use Barnes and Noble to find an "about info" on the book (the back of the dust cover info)

And probably sticking with amzon or Barnes and Noble for the reviews

I did a wide search for gothic fonts and found a few that are close to the Dracula theme but will also be readable

I then did research and looked at a lot of "dark sites" that are out there to get inspiration and to see what NOT to do. 
I immediately realized the complexity of trying to build a darker themed site. A lot of the come off really cheesy or just overwhelming and most do not seem like a serious/professional site

Building the site:
I wanted to keep it clean so that it didn't look as cheesy as some of the "dark sites" that i had previously viewed.
Becasue of wanting to keep it simple, I wanted to keep some colour in it and add a little pizazz to it so i chose to do a sticky navigation bar so that the dracula style font and colour would roll through out the site when you scroll down.

I made the navigation bar/page buttons to click on change in colour and fade into the colour for a better and more understanable UX
i kept the home page/nav button be "dracula" i just like the styling of it/

I kept all of the pages in pretty much the exact same style for a better ux so that people knew that they were on the same site

I am amazed at how much help is out on the web to find solutions to coding problems.
it took me some time to get everything set up the way i wanted to look but then it got a liitle fun from there.
