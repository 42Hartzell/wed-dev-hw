READ ME 
The information that my page was aiming to deliver was; what, why, and hows about RWD
The first information that I set out for users was the header of  “Responsive Design”

I wrote the content up and then there are links that give a deeper look onto the subjects that were covered in the page….
I found a colour pallet that I liked and thought was fun to implement
I did sketch something up but felt it was kind of silly for such a small page
It had the four columns for the phone size then the header and footer with two boxes in the middle
