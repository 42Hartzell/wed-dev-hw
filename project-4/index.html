            </h2>
            <p>
                Here are two examples of tools that are used to aid in responsiveness:
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Wireframes</strong> are your basic storyboarding sketches to showcase examples of what the site is going to look like on different screens and how the content will be represented.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Flexboxes</strong> are a way to implement scalability with CSS. This tool gives you control of how your content will look on different sizes with ease.
